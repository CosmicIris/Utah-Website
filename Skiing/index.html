  <h1> Skiing </h1>
<p> Each winter, Utah’s is blessed with an average of 500 inches of powdery snow, making it the perfect destination for skiing. Three of the best ski resorts 
  in Utah include Snowbird, Brighton, and Alta.
  </p>
  <br> </br>
 <p1> Snowbird is great for skiers who are more advanced, with terrain that is challenging but not overwhelming.This ski resort also has an aerial tram, 
   which brings guests 2,900 feet up to Hidden Peak, the resort’s highest elevation at 11,000 feet.
  </p1>
  <br> </br>
  <p2> Brighton may not offer a wide variety of activities, although it is one of the best ski resorts in Utah for families, as it features trails with 
    different difficulty levels depending on a skier’s level of experience and allows up to two kids (10 and under) to ski for free with a paying 
    or pass-holding adult.
 </p2>
<br> </br>
<p3> Alta is more of a ski area than a resort, so you won’t find much shopping or dining options. Nonetheless, it is a skiers-only resort, so you can 
  enjoy all the tree runs and extreme steeps that it’s known for.
