  <h1> National Parks </h1>
<p> Utah is home to The Mighty Five: Arches National Park, 
  Bryce Canyon National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, and  Zion National Park.
  </p>
  <br> </br>
 <p1> Arches National Park contains many trails that let you get an up close view of its impressive arches, including Broken Arch Trail (1.9 miles round trip),
   Landscape Arch Trail (1.8 miles round trip), and Park Avenue Viewpoint and Trail (1.8 miles roundtrip). 
  </p1>
  <br> </br>
  <p2> Bryce Canyon National Park offers 2 hour and 3 hour guided horseback riding, which begin in April and usually end in late October. </p2>
<br> </br>
<p3> Canyonlands National Park is unique in that you can plan a flatwater trip that either floats down the Greenwater or Colorado rivers. You will need a permit 
  for all flatwater trips, which you can purchase through recreation.gov.
 </p3>
<br> </br>
<p4> The many rock layers found at Capitol Reef offer a diverse environment for canyoneering. Canyoneering routes to try out include Pandora’s box, 
  Arch Nemisis Canyon, and Bless Canyone. You will also need a permit to go canyoneering at Capitol Reef, although you can get a permit for free by 
  emailing care_permits@nps.gov.
</p4>
<br> </br>
<p5> Two hikes Zions National Park is known are Angel’s Landing and The Narrows. Angel’s Landing is a day hike that leads to a lofty summit and reaches 
  an elevation of almost 6,000 feet. You will need a permit to be able to hike Angel’s Landing, which you can get by entering a lottery through 
  www.recreation.gov. The Narrows is a hike through a slot canyon that features some incredible rock formations and does not require a permit. 
  Both hikes are strenuous in difficulty, although there are much easier hikes that you can do, such as the Trail and the Grotto Trail.
