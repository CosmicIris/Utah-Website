<p> 6:29 pm Two hikes Zions National Park is known are Angel’s Landing and The Narrows. Angel’s Landing is a day hike that leads to a lofty summit and reaches 
  an elevation of almost 6,000 feet. You will need a permit to be able to hike Angel’s Landing, which you can get by entering a lottery through 
  www.recreation.gov. The Narrows is a hike through a slot canyon that features some incredible rock formations and does not require a permit. 
  Both hikes are strenuous in difficulty, although there are much easier hikes that you can do, such as the Pa'rus Trail and the Grotto Trail.
