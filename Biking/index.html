      you’ll discover scenic trails for all levels. Whether you want to feel the thrill of mountain biking or just want to enjoy
      some beautiful scenery, you’ll love biking on these three incredible mountain biking trails. </p>

    <h2> Lost Prospector </h2>
    <p> Located on the east side of Park City, this is an easier mountain biking trail. This trail is great for beginners, as it’s only 
      600 feet of vertical climbing. You can either opt for the 6 mile roundtrip bike ride on dirt only or do the 7.8 mile loop returning 
      via the Rail Trail, which splits the ride between dirt and pavement. The loop is the easier option. Throughout this ride, you will 
      get some awesome views of Park City and the surrounding mountains. </p>
