    <h1> Lost Prospector </h1>
    <p> Located on the east side of Park City, this is an easier mountain biking trail. This trail is great for beginners, as it’s only 
      600 feet of vertical climbing. You can either opt for the 6 mile roundtrip bike ride on dirt only or do the 7.8 mile loop returning 
      via the Rail Trail, which splits the ride between dirt and pavement. The loop is the easier option. Throughout this ride, you will 
      get some awesome views of Park City and the surrounding mountains. </p>

  includes a difficult uphill part of 1,600 feet or 4,000 feet of vertical climb, depending on which route you choose. Though the climb 
  is tough, you’ll find that it’s worth it, as you’ll get a spectacular view of the Wasatch Mountain range once you get to the top. </p>
    <br> </br>
  <h1> Slickrock Trail </h1>
